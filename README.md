👋 Hi, I’m Arbaz

I’m a backend-focused engineer who enjoys building systems from first principles — networking, concurrency, security, and observability — instead of relying on heavy abstractions.

Recently, I built a TLS-secured, multithreaded chat server in Java featuring:

Custom application-level protocol

X.509 / PKI–based TLS

Thread pools, connection limits, and backpressure

Concurrent state management

Basic observability primitives

---
I’m currently expanding into Web3 infrastructure, exploring how decentralized systems handle:

RPC architecture

Consensus-adjacent infra

Security at the protocol layer

Reliability in adversarial environments

I believe strong engineers understand how systems work under the hood, not just how to use them.
