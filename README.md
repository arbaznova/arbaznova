## 🛠 Projects

### 1. Secure Multithreaded Chat Server
**Technologies:** Java, TLS, X.509 PKI, TCP, Concurrency

**Description:**  
A production-oriented real-time chat server engineered from the ground up using core Java. Designed for high concurrency, secure messaging, and scalability without relying on external frameworks.

**Key Features:**
- Custom application-layer protocol with command-based routing
- TLS-secured communication using X.509 certificates
- Thread-pool–driven concurrency with backpressure handling
- Lock-free registries for user and session management
- Observability hooks for monitoring server health
- Chatbot-ready architecture for future AI integration

**Status:** ✅ Working

### 2. LLM-Powered Chatbot Service (Java–Python Integration)
**Technologies:** Python, FastAPI, LLM APIs, Java integration, TLS

**Description:**  
A Python-based chatbot service designed to integrate with my Java chat server. Enables conversational AI responses with session-aware context and a pluggable backend architecture.

**Key Features:**
- Secure, language-agnostic protocol bridge between Java server and Python service
- Session-aware conversation memory for multi-turn interactions
- Prompt orchestration and routing layers to control AI responses
- Low-latency design with future support for token-level streaming
- Backend-only exposure to ensure secure deployment
- Pluggable LLM integration to swap AI providers without affecting server

**Status:** ⚙️ In Progress
