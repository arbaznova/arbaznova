# ⚔️ Hardcore Backend Systems Engineer | Java • Concurrency • Distributed Systems

> **I don’t build CRUD apps. I build systems that survive load, concurrency, and failure.**

## 🧠 Who I Am (No Fluff)

I am a **backend systems–obsessed engineer** focused on **how things work under pressure** — threads, sockets, memory, execution models, and system boundaries.

I deliberately work **below frameworks** before I touch them. If a system breaks, I want to know *which thread*, *which lock*, and *which assumption* failed.

My mindset is simple:

* ⚙️ **Understand the internals**
* 🧱 **Build from first principles**
* 🔥 **Optimize only after correctness**

Long-term, I am not aiming to be “just another backend dev.” I am aiming for **systems architecture, large-scale distributed platforms, and technical leadership in AI/Tech**.

## 🧨 Core Weapons (Tech Stack)

### Languages

* **Java (Advanced / Systems-Level)** – Concurrency, Multithreading, JVM behavior
* SQL
* Bash

### Backend & Systems Engineering

* Low-level **Socket Programming (TCP/IP)**
* **Multithreaded Server Design**
* Thread Pools (`ExecutorService`) & Task Scheduling
* Blocking I/O & Request Lifecycles
* REST APIs (only when appropriate)
* Spring Boot (used consciously, not blindly)

### Concurrency & Architecture

* Thread Safety & Synchronization
* Producer–Consumer Systems
* Readers–Writers Problem
* Locks, Monitors, and Shared State Control
* SOLID & Clean Architecture
* Client–Server & Layered Architectures

### Tooling & Environment

* Git 
* Maven / Gradle
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Linux

## 🧩 Flagship Projects (Built to Learn, Not to Impress Beginners)

### 🔥 Multithreaded Java TCP Server

**What it actually is:**
A ground-up **concurrent TCP server** designed to handle multiple clients using a **thread-pool-driven execution model**, with strict separation of I/O, execution, and lifecycle control.

**Why it matters:**
Because real backend problems start **before HTTP** and **after concurrency**.

**Highlights:**

* Thread-safe request handling
* Custom socket reader/writer abstractions
* Executor-backed concurrency model
* Graceful connection and shutdown handling

**Concepts:**
`Sockets` · `Thread Pools` · `Blocking I/O` · `Concurrency` · `Server Design`

## 🛠️ Upcoming Backend-Heavy Projects (Planned & In Progress)

### NOVABASE ##
A backend platform designed for Java developers who hate Firebase

### 🏴‍☠️ API Reliability Blackbox **(FLAGSHIP)**

A blackbox system designed to **stress, observe, and expose API failures under real-world conditions** — without needing source code access.

**What it does:**

* Synthetic traffic generation at scale
* Latency, error-rate, and timeout profiling
* Failure pattern detection (cascading, partial, silent)
* SLA/SLO validation under load

**Why it matters:**
Because most APIs *work* — until they don’t. This system is built to answer **why they fail**.

---

### 🧾 Resume-as-an-API

Your resume, but **machine-consumable, queryable, and versioned**.

**Concepts:**

* REST-first design
* Versioned schemas
* Structured career data
* Designed for ATS systems, recruiters, and internal tooling

**Why it exists:**
Because PDFs are dead and backend engineers should expose themselves as **interfaces**, not documents.

---

### ⏱️ Cron-as-a-Service

A backend service to **schedule, execute, and monitor jobs reliably at scale**.

**Core Challenges:**

* Distributed scheduling
* Exactly-once vs at-least-once execution
* Retry semantics & failure recovery
* Time drift & execution guarantees

**Why it’s hard:**
Because cron is easy — **reliable cron is not**.

---

### 💸 Infrastructure Cost Autopsy

A backend system that **dissects infrastructure bills** and explains *where the money actually went*.

**Features:**

* Service-level cost attribution
* Usage anomaly detection
* Cost-to-traffic correlation
* Actionable optimization signals

**Why it matters:**
Because most infra costs are paid blindly, not understood.

---

## 📚 Current Focus

* Advanced Java Concurrency & JVM internals
* Distributed Systems fundamentals
* System Design under real-world constraints
* Low-level networking & performance tuning

## 📎 Final Note

If you’re looking for shiny demos, this profile is not for you.
If you’re interested in **how real backend systems are built and stressed**, you’re in the right place.
